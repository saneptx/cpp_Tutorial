    People are now increasingly aware of the danger of 'appearance anxiety' or being obessed with one's looks.From my perspective,it is advisable for young people to improve individual ability rather than focus excessively physical appereance, provided that they intends to gain personal sufficient achievements.
    Living in an era of information explosion,social online usually spread the viewpoint that apperarance is importance.As a matter of affact,a vast majority of people are ordinary individuals,for us,appearance is not of significant importance.Young people need to place importance on developing concrete skills and enhancing their personal capabilities which will enables them to cope with challenges and seize opportunities effectively.A typical example is one of my friends,she used to feel anxious because she thought she was not enough pretty.Anxiety had a negative impact on her both academic performance and daily life.Finally,at advice of another friend,she gradually realized that appearance is not the most important thing and attach shiftef her attention from appearance to study.
    Only when young people truly realize that inner qualities and personal abilities are more important than physical apperarance,can they gain long-term benefits both mentally and in life.As a college student,I am convinced that it is of great necessity for students to develop themselves and not focus too much on their looks.

    Today there is a growing awareness that mental well-being needs to be given as much attention as physical health.From my perspective,it is advisable for young people to place as much importance on mental health as physical health,provided that they intend to achieve personal growth and success in the long run.
    Living in a fast-paced era,people face pressure not only from physical factors but also from mental stress.As a matter of fact,sometimes,mental stress is harder to bear than physical stress.People need to place importance on mental health, which enables them to cope with challenges and seize opportunities effectively.A typical example is one of my friends.He often felt anxious, fearing that he wouldn't be able to find a decent job.Anxiety had a negative impact on him, both academic and daily life.Finally, he overcame his anxiety by doing sports and communicating with others.
    Only when young people truly realize the value of mental well-being,can they gain long-term benefits, both mentally and practically.As a college student,I am convinced that it is of great necessity for students to place sufficient emphasis on their mental health.
