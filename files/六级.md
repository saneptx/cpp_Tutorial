	People are now increasingly aware of the danger of "appearance anxiety" or being obsessed with one's looks. From my perspective, it is advisable for young people to improve their individual abilities rather than focus excessively on physical appearance, provided that they intend to gain sufficient personal achievements.

	Living in an era of information explosion, social media often spreads the view that appearance is important. As a matter of fact, the vast majority of people are ordinary individuals. For us, appearance is not of significant importance. Young people need to place importance on developing concrete skills and enhancing their personal capabilities, which enables them to cope with challenges and seize opportunities effectively. A typical example is one of my friends: she used to feel anxious because she thought she was not pretty enough. Anxiety had a negative impact on both her academic performance and daily life. Finally, on the advice of another friend, she gradually realized that appearance is not the most important thing and shifted her attention from appearance to study.

	Only when young people truly realize that inner qualities and personal abilities are more important than physical appearance can they gain long-term benefits, both mentally and in life. As a college student, I am convinced that it is of great necessity for students to develop themselves rather than focus too much on their looks.

*For this part,you are allowed 30 minutes to write an essay than begins with the sentence "Today there is a growing awareness that mental well-being needs to be given as much attention as physical health" You can make comments,cite examples or use your personal experiences to develop your essay.You should write at least 150 words but not more than 200 words.*

~~~
	Today, there is a growing awareness that mental well-being deserves no less attention than physical health. From my perspective, it is advisable for young people to place equal importance on mental health, as doing so plays a crucial role in achieving personal growth and long-term success.

	Living in a fast-paced era, people face increasing pressure not only from physical demands but also from mental stress. In fact, mental burdens can sometimes be even harder to endure than physical ones. Therefore, it is essential for individuals to prioritize their mental well-being, which enables them to cope with challenges and seize opportunities more effectively. For example, one of my friends used to feel anxious because he feared he wouldn't be able to find a decent job. This anxiety had a negative impact on both his academic performance and daily life. Eventually, with encouragement from others, he managed to overcome his anxiety through regular exercise and open communication.

	Only when young people truly recognize the importance of mental health can they enjoy long-term benefits both mentally and practically. As a college student, I firmly believe that it is of great necessity for students to attach sufficient importance to their mental well-being in order to thrive in both academic and future professional life.

*For this part,you are allowed 30 minutes to write an essay than begins with the sentence "When faced with differing opinions,we should try to reach agreement through friendly discussion and reasonable argument" You can make comments,cite examples or use your personal experiences to develop your essay.You should write at least 150 words but not more than 200 words.*

~~~
	When faced with differing opinions, we should try to reach an agreement through friendly discussion and reasonable argument. From my perspective, friendly communication and reasonable argument are effective ways to resolve differences in teamwork tasks. It is important to learn to get along with others in a friendly way, provided that people intend to achieve personal growth and long-term success.

	Living in an era of rapid economic development, people often need to work with others to accomplish their goals. In fact, the ability to cooperate in a friendly and effective way is not only a valuable personal trait but also a sign of strong interpersonal competence. College students need to cultivate their teamwork skills and the ability to resolve differences, which enable them to cope with challenges in their future careers. For example, one of my friends often participated in club activities and worked with other members to complete tasks. This experience helped him perform well in his job.

	Only when young people truly realize the importance of cooperating with others in a friendly manner and developing the ability to resolve differences can they gain long-term benefits, both mentally and practically. As a college student, I am convinced that it is of great necessity for students to attach great importance to teamwork skills.

~~~
	It is widely accepted that an important goal of education is to help students learn how to learn. From my perspective, it is advisable for young people to place importance on mastering effective learning methods during their studies, provided that they intend to achieve personal growth and long-term success.

	Living in an era of rapid economic development, mastering how to learn is even more important than learning itself. Young people need to summarize effective learning strategies from their study and work experiences so as to gain the ability to acquire new knowledge quickly, which enables them to cope with challenges and seize opportunities effectively. A typical example is one of my friends. He places great emphasis on mastering efficient learning techniques and applying them in practice, which has helped him achieve outstanding academic performance.

	Only when young people truly realize that knowing how to learn is more important than learning itself can they gain long-term benefits in both work and life. As a college student, I am convinced that it is of great necessity for students to attach importance to learning how to learn.

**For those people <u>who earn less but eager to own a decent and comfortable place of their own in a big city</u>,the high housing price is a heavy burden that <u>they cannot afford</u>.**

> 非限制性定语从句修饰的是事。
>
> 非限制性定语从句的运用很广泛，最常用的是：当题目中出现“这，该，其”这样的字眼，指代前面说的那件事情，我们就要想到用非限制性定语从句。

**大学生之间的竞争也越来越激烈，<u>这导致任何一名大学生找到工作的机会都变小了</u>。**

>
> 绝大多数的多动句都是使用非谓语动词的方式来处理多动句。哪个动词离主语近，哪个就处理成谓语动词，其他动词全部处理成非谓语动词。把靠近主语最近的那个动词作为谓语动词，其他部分作为非谓语动词即可，要注意主动的处理成现在分词-ing，被动要处理成过去分词-ed，表示目的的，处理成动词不定式to do。

	Recently with the development of science and technology,the phenomenon that young people are unable to recognize false information on the Internet has aroused wide concern.From my perspective,it is advisable for young people to improve the ability to recognize false information, thus avoid being impacted by fake online information. 
	Living in an era of information,an increasing number of young people spend a lot of time on the Internet and browsing a varity of information.As a matter of fact,over 90 percent of information is unreliable on the Internet.Therefore,young people need to maintain critical thinking and make rational judgments when browsing the Internet,which prevents them from being misled by false content.On the other hand, it is necessary for young people to decrease the amount of time they spend on the Internet and place more importance on real life.
	Only when young people truly learning to keep independent thinking when browsing Internet, can they gain real effective of knowledge for them.To conclude,when surfing the Internet, we should be alert and bear in mind that the Inernet is just a virtual world.

It is known as the "cradle of the Chinese revolution" because of its glorious revolutionary history.In October 1927, Mao Zedong, Zhu De, and other revolutionary leaders led the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army to this area, where they launched a hard and extraordinary struggle.They established the first rural revolutionary base, ignited the spark of the Chinese revolution, and pioneered a revolutionary path with Chinese characteristics—encircling the cities from the countryside and seizing power through armed struggle. From here, the Chinese revolution moved toward victory.With more than 100 revolutionary sites,Jinggang Mountain has now become a "revolutionary history museum without walls" as well as an important education base for patriotism and revolutionary traditions.
